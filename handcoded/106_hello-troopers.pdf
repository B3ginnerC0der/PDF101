%     - What do you need to change in order to make the PDF page a standard "A4" size?                   %
%     - What happens if you change the PDF page size to a standard "Letter" size?                        %
%     - Can you make one of the colors also "magenta", "cyan" or "yellow"?                               %
%     - How do you make the text color "white"?                                                          %
%     - Can you still somehow discover white text if the PDF is rendered in the viewer?                  %
%     - Can you figure out which specific effect each of the 6 operands of the `cm` operators has?       %
%     - Play around with a few of the operand values of the `cm` operator.                               %
%     - Play around with a few of the operand values of the `g`, `G`, `rg` and `RG` operators.           %
%     - Can you extract the text from the PDF using the `pdftotext` utility?                             %
%     - Does the result look good?                                                                       %
