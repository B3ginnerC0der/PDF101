# Useful tricks to know when editing PDF files with VIM

1. Always start up using *`vim -b`*!
   *(Without the `-b` Vim would try to do its clever tricks on a binary-including file the wrong way.)*
   Make this a habit.
   Only binary editing mode (as triggered by *`-b`*) will correctly give byte-counting if needed.

1. Once a PDF is open, you can use the *`:goto 3456`* command to jump to byte offset 3456.
   Useful if you want to check `xref` entries.

1. Remember, how to open (in your default PDF viewer) the currently edited PDF file from within Vim:
   *`:!open %`* (OSX), *`:!xdg-open %`* (Linux), *`:!start %`* (Windows).
   (You know that *`%`* is a VIM shorthand variable for 'currently opened file', right?)

1. Define a custom status line which returns useful info about the current cursor position.
   Here is a suggestion:

 Â  **`:statusline=%F%m%r%h%w[%L][%{&ff}]%y[%p%%][%04l,%04v](%b)(%B)(%o)`**

    What these settings mean:

    ````
    %F     :   currently open file name (with full path)
    %m     :   modified flag (*`[+]`* if modified)
    %r     :   readonly flag (*`[RO]`* if readonly)
    %h     :   helpfile flag (*`[help]`* if helpfile -- maybe localized as *`[Hilfe]`*)
    %w     :   preview window flag (*`[Preview]`* if applicable)
    %L     :   total lines
    %{&ff} :   file format (unix, dos,...)
    %y     :   file type as automatically recognized or manually set
    %p%%   :   relative position of cursor within file in percent
    %06l   :   current line position (column) of cursor, left padded with zeroes
    %06v   :   current line/row number of cursor, left padded with zeroes
    %b     :   ASCII value of the current character under cursor
    %B     :   HEX value of current character under cursor
    %o     :   file byte offset of cursor
    ````


   Now a quick look on the status line shows the current file byte offset, line position, HEX value of character,...

1. How to jump to a specific byte offset (calculated from the start of the file):

        :goto 37737

    or

        :go 37737

    or simply (without the `:` to switch to command mode):

        37737go

1. Looking at binary bytes? But want them displayed as Hex? Then try this:

        :set display=uhex

    Otherwise, the `ga` command displays the value of the character under the cursor.

    `g CTRL+g` shows which byte offset you are at in the file.
